Sometimes on a Mac, not all attached displays are immediately detected (such as if you open the lid on a MacBook Pro while attached to an external monitor or if you boot a Mac on a KVM while it isn't the active device). This tool has the same effect as clicking "Detect Displays" in the "Displays" System Preferences pane, making it suitable for a LaunchAgent to detect displays at login.
